# Tulipcoin

Tulipcoin is the hot new cryptocurrency without all the fat of other popular cryptocurrencies: security, performance, scalability and decentralisation.

## Features

### Security

Who really cares about security? Our precious development man-hours were spent on over-optimizing modules with absolutely no gain in performance, guaranteed.

### Performance

Blazingly fast, and blazingly useless.

### Scalability

One network - one host. Packing the entire network into a single machine makes flipping the light off at night an adventurous gamble.

### Centralized control

With a centralized model of control it is much easier to enforce your will on other peoples crypto-wallets. Enjoy the freedom of fully controlling *your* coin, and being able to ignore the opinions of others.

## Installation & build

To install all dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```

Then build the source code (uses TypeScript to compile):

```console
$ npm build
```

It's also possible to setup a TypeScript watcher that compiles automatically on changes to source files:

```console
$ npm watch
```

## Requirements

Node.JS is required.
